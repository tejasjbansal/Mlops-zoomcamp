#### 1. Introduction

The focus is on the best practices for deploying machine learning models into production. The course uses a real-world example of predicting taxi ride durations to illustrate key concepts. The process of machine learning projects is simplified into three stages: design, train, and operate. In the design stage, it's determined if machine learning is the right tool for the problem. If so, the train stage involves experimenting to find the best model. The operate stage includes deploying the model as a web service and ensuring it performs well over time. MLOps practices help automate and streamline these stages, making it easier to reproduce results, deploy models, and monitor their performance.

#### 1.4 MLOps maturity model
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) maturity refers to the level of sophistication and effectiveness in managing and operationalizing machine learning (ML) systems within an organization. It represents the organization’s ability to develop, deploy, monitor, and maintain ML models in a reliable and scalable manner. MLOps maturity typically evolves through different stages, which can vary depending on the framework or model used. Here is a general overview of the stages:

Ad hoc: In the early stages, ML development is ad hoc and lacks a systematic approach. Models are developed and deployed manually without standardized processes or version control. There is limited collaboration between data scientists and IT/DevOps teams.

Managed: As organizations recognize the importance of ML, they start implementing basic management practices. Version control is introduced, and models are tracked. However, there might still be manual steps involved, and deployment processes may not be well-defined.

Automated: At this stage, automation plays a crucial role in MLOps. Organizations adopt continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate model training, evaluation, and deployment. Infrastructure provisioning, testing, and monitoring become more streamlined. There is a stronger collaboration between data scientists, software engineers, and IT/DevOps teams.

Orchestrated: MLOps processes are integrated and orchestrated across the entire ML lifecycle. Advanced automation tools and frameworks are employed to manage the complexity of ML workflows. There is a focus on reproducibility, model versioning, and experiment tracking. ML models are deployed in a scalable and efficient manner, making use of containerization and orchestration platforms.

Governed: MLOps is fully integrated into the organization’s governance framework. Compliance, security, and regulatory considerations are taken into account throughout the ML lifecycle. Model performance and monitoring are monitored continuously, and feedback loops are established to improve models over time. Model explainability and interpretability are given importance.

Achieving higher levels of MLOps maturity requires investment in infrastructure, tooling, and establishing best practices. It also involves fostering collaboration and communication between different teams involved in ML development and deployment. Organizations with higher MLOps maturity are better equipped to handle the challenges of scaling ML projects, ensuring model reliability, and maximizing the value derived from ML initiatives.
